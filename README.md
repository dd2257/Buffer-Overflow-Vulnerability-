# Buffer Overflow Vulnerability Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation related to the exploration and exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The project includes practical demonstrations of how buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be used to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and defeat security mechanisms such as address space randomization.

## Contents

- `cshell.c`: A simple shellcode to gain root privileges by exploiting set-uid bit.
- `call_shellcode.c`: Code to execute shellcode directly from a buffer.
- `stack.c`: A vulnerable program used to demonstrate buffer overflow exploitation.
- `exploit.py`: A Python script to create a malicious payload (`badfile`) to exploit the vulnerability in `stack.c`.
- `exploit_dash.py`: Modified exploit to bypass DASH shell countermeasures.
- `drandomize.sh`: Script to defeat address space randomization and execute the `stack` program until successful exploitation.

## Tasks Covered

1. **Running Shellcode**: Gaining root shell by executing shellcode.
2. **Exploiting the Vulnerability**: Creating exploits to gain root privileges.
3. **Defeating DASH's Countermeasure**: Bypassing security measures to obtain root shell.
4. **Defeating Address Randomization**: Exploiting buffer overflow while address randomization is enabled.

## How to Use

1. Compile the C code files using `gcc` with appropriate flags (e.g., `-fno-stack-protector`, `-z execstack`).
2. Run the exploits (`exploit.py`, `exploit_dash.py`) to create payloads and execute them with the vulnerable program (`stack`).
3. Use `gdb` for debugging and analyzing the vulnerable program to identify buffer addresses and offsets.

## Requirements

- Linux environment (preferably Ubuntu)
- GCC compiler
- Python 3.x
- GDB debugger

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only. It demonstrates how buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited in a controlled environment. Misuse of this knowledge in unauthorized environments is illegal and unethical.
